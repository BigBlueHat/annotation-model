    A poem about spaces, and finding something again.  Words 
        challenge divisions,
        out of view,
        back to the same root.

            A beautiful soup
            of wavy text,
            images,
            and emoji gardens.

            A maze. 

            A gauntlet.

                From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the
                tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now
                poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
                and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.

                A voiceless song sang from within, singing:

                A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
                hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
                called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s
                leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.

                She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
                dreamily rose.

            [ CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears ]
              </h2>
        
        <p>
                &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;a great girl like
                    you,&rsquo; (she might well say this), &lsquo;to go on crying in this way! Stop this
                    moment, I tell you!&rsquo; But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
                    tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep
                    and reaching half down the hall.
        </p>

        <p>
                &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t cried so much!&rsquo; said Alice, as she swam about, trying to
                find her way out. &lsquo;I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being
                drowned in my own tears! That <i>will</i> be a queer thing, to be sure! However,
                everything is queer to-day.&rsquo; 
        </p>

        <p>
                Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
                off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it
                must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she
                was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped
                in like herself.
        </p>


        <p>
           And she kept on puzzling
            about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
            something like this:&mdash;
         </p>
              <pre style="height:300px; width: 600px; overflow:scroll;">
                       &lsquo;Fury said to a
                       mouse, That he
                      met in the
                     house,
                   &ldquo;Let us
                    both go to
                     law: <i>I</i> will
                      prosecute
                       <i>you</i>.&mdash;Come,
                         I&rsquo;ll take no
                         denial; We
                        must have a
                      trial: For
                    really this
                   morning I&rsquo;ve
                  nothing
                  to do.&rdquo;
                    Said the
                    mouse to the
                     cur, &ldquo;Such
                      a trial,
                       dear Sir,
                          With
                        no jury
                      or judge,
                     would be
                    wasting
                    our
                    breath.&rdquo;
                      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
                      judge, I&rsquo;ll
                       be jury,&rdquo;
                           Said
                       cunning
                        old Fury:
                        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
                        try the
                          whole
                          cause,
                            and
                         condemn
                         you
                        to
                         death.&rdquo;&rsquo;
              </pre>
                  <p>
                    &lsquo;You are not attending!&rsquo; said the Mouse to Alice severely. &lsquo;What are you
                    thinking of?&rsquo; 
                  </p>

            The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
            at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
            her in a languid, sleepy voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lsquo;Who are <i>you</i>?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
            rather shyly, &lsquo;I&mdash;I hardly know, sir, just at present&mdash;at least
            I know who I <i>was</i> when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
            changed several times since then.&rsquo; 
          </p>
          <p>
                &lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar sternly. &lsquo;Explain
                yourself!&rsquo; 
              </p>
              <p>
                &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t explain <i>myself</i>, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;because I&rsquo;m not
                myself, you see.&rsquo; 
              </p>
              <p>
                &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
              </p>
              <p>
                &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t put it more clearly,&rsquo; Alice replied very politely,
                &lsquo;for I can&rsquo;t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
                different sizes in a day is very confusing.&rsquo; 
              </p>
              <p>
                &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the Caterpillar.
              </p>
              <p>
                &lsquo;Well, perhaps you haven&rsquo;t found it so yet,&rsquo; said Alice; &lsquo;but when you
                have to turn into a chrysalis&mdash;you will some day, you know&mdash;and
                then after that into a butterfly, I should think you&rsquo;ll feel it a little
                queer, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
